  <description>What better way is there to take revenge on mechanoids than to hack them, and use them as your own combat slaves? With What the Hack!? you can raise your own squad of blood machines. This is not all: You can also apply various upgrades to mechanoids like a turret module for mounting turrets on them, a belt module for equipping belts like shield belts, and various other modules. Moreover you can use your hacked mechanoids as pack-mules during world travel, raid factions with them, you can control them directly with a controller belt, or implant an AI persona core in them for indefinite control. Beware though, hacking has its dangers, and other technologically advanced factions also know how to hack, so expect hacked mechanoids in enemy raids.
